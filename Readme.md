### FAQ

> A: ~~As soon as I obtain files from other public places including bbs, dm, etc., but I will not put them right away if I consider it was too new to put it here (`n-0`, which I never had a chance to get any). However, if you already got files that is not yet uploaded here, you can dm me to request a converted copy.~~
